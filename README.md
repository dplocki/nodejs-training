# üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è NodeJS training code

The code for NodeJS training. And Docker.

Some time ago, the company which I was working in, started this Node course for its developers. I volunteer. No idea what happens with the rest of code from this project.

## Run with Docker

```sh
docker build -t nodejs_training .
docker run ¬≠--rm -p 13000:3000 -v $(pwd):/usr/src/app/ -it nodejs_training
```

Enter address: http://localhost:13000

## Run directly

```sh
npm install
npm start
```

Enter address: http://localhost:3000

## Development run

```sh
sudo npm install nodemon -g
npm run watch
```

Enter address: http://localhost:3000
